        <h3>suffering</h3>
        <h5>An oil project i completed as my undergraduate capstone project in may 2021.<br><br>
        Inspired by both neoclassicism & expressionism, i was drawn to depict these myths for a reason<br>i could not place. After their completion, it became clear that an inner part of me, one which i could not put into words, had come out in visual form. Ultimately, this project was a realization and acceptance of the injustice of life: a resignation to the forces of nature that make some win and others lose.</h5>

                Theirs is the archetypal tragedy. The grief of<br>death, the ardor of the journey down and back,<br>none of it enough to please the whims of the gods. Each eternally punished, but for what crime?

                I didn't know why i painted her until after<br>i finished. Within her petrifying gaze i can<br>see the sorrow and pain of an innocent<br>maiden punished and persecuted for glory.

                <h4>oil on canvas. 18"x24".<br><br>
                I was taught the story of narcissus as a condemnation of narcissism and<br>self-obsession. But i guess i have always found it difficult to absorb the<br>lesson. As long as i'm not hurting anyone, can i not embrace<br>my own cultivated qualities?
